# Multiple LM2596 Buck Converter

Single input, Multiple Output Voltage Buck Converter

## Description

This project was made to create multiple output voltage from a single 24V input power supply, There are 3 devices that design to powered by this buck converter : 2 LED Monitor and 1 Wi-Fi Router. The output voltage is 20V for the Monitor and 9V for the router. 
This project also made for learning and practice to design a proper power converter board

## Design
The board designed with Altium Designer, it is a 2 layer board with main buck converter IC is LM2596 ASynchronous Buck Converter
